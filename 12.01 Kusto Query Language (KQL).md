**Kusto Query Language (KQL)** is a powerful, read-only language developed by Microsoft for querying structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. In Azure, it is most commonly used in **Azure Monitor Logs** (Log Analytics), **Azure Data Explorer**, and **Microsoft Sentinel** for analyzing logs, metrics, and telemetry data.

KQL is designed to be easy to read and write, using a data-flow model where data is passed from one command (operator) to the next using the **pipe character** (`|`). The query generally starts with a table name and then applies filters, aggregations, and projections sequentially.

## Key KQL Operators

| Operator | Purpose | SQL Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tablename` | The starting point of the query, specifying the data source. | `FROM tablename` |
| `where` | Filters the table's rows based on a specific condition. | `WHERE` |
| `project` | Selects specific columns to include in the output. | `SELECT` |
| `summarize` | Groups data and calculates aggregations (e.g., count, sum, average). | `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions |
| `extend` | Creates a new calculated column. | N/A (similar to a calculated column in `SELECT`) |
| `order by` | Sorts the result set by one or more columns. | `ORDER BY` |
| `take` | Limits the number of rows returned. | `TOP` or `LIMIT` |

## KQL Queries for Common Scenarios

Here are a few example queries using KQL to understand common Azure monitoring scenarios. These are typically run in the **Log Analytics** workspace in Azure Monitor.

### 1\. Simple Data Retrieval and Filtering

**Scenario:** Get the last 10 records from the `SecurityEvent` table that represent a successful login (EventID 4624) in the last hour.

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == 4624
| take 10
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Account
```

  * `SecurityEvent`: Specifies the table to query.
  * `where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)`: Filters records to only those created in the last 1 hour.
  * `where EventID == 4624`: Filters to a specific Windows Event ID for successful logons.
  * `take 10`: Limits the output to 10 records.
  * `project ...`: Selects and displays only the `TimeGenerated`, `Computer`, and `Account` columns.

### 2\. Aggregation and Time-Series Analysis

**Scenario:** Count the total number of errors (`Level == 2`) per computer over the last 7 days, grouped by day.

```kql
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize DailyErrorCount = countif(Computer == "Error") by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| render timechart 
```

  * `Heartbeat`: Specifies the table (often used for agent status).
  * `summarize ... by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)`: Groups the records by a 1-day interval (`bin`) and calculates a count of records where the `Computer` column equals "Error" (using `countif`).
  * `render timechart`: Displays the results as a line chart over time. (Note: The `Heartbeat` table doesn't have an error level, but this demonstrates the syntax for summarizing by time).

### 3\. Calculating Percentiles and Sorting

**Scenario:** Find the 95th percentile and average duration of application requests in the last 24 hours, grouped by the request name.

```kql
AppRequests
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize 
    AvgDuration = avg(DurationMs), 
    P95Duration = percentile(DurationMs, 95), 
    TotalRequests = count()
  by OperationName
| order by P95Duration desc
```

  * `AppRequests`: Specifies the table for application request data.
  * `summarize ... by OperationName`: Groups the results by the request name and calculates the average duration, the 95th percentile duration, and the total count of requests.
  * `order by P95Duration desc`: Sorts the final result table to show the slowest requests first.

The **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** supports several **scalar data types**, which are single values that hold specific kinds of data. These are the fundamental types used for columns in KQL tables, variables defined with `let` statements, and values returned by functions.

The core scalar data types in KQL are:

| Type Name | Alternative Name(s) | Description | Example Literal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`string`** | | A sequence of zero or more Unicode characters (text). | `"Hello, KQL"` |
| **`long`** | `int` | A signed 64-bit integer (whole number). `int` is also supported but resolves to a 32-bit signed integer. | `123456` |
| **`real`** | `double` | A 64-bit double-precision floating-point number (decimal numbers). | `1.23` or `1.0` |
| **`decimal`** | | A 128-bit wide decimal number, used for high-precision calculations like currency. | `decimal(10.99)` |
| **`bool`** | `boolean` | A logical value that is either **`true`** (`1`) or **`false`** (`0`). | `true` or `false` |
| **`datetime`** | `date` | An instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day (up to the millisecond). | `datetime(2025-10-04 10:00:00)` |
| **`timespan`** | `time` | A time interval, representing a duration of time (e.g., 5 days, 1 hour). | `5d` or `1h` or `timespan(0.01:00:00)` |
| **`guid`** | `uuid`, `uniqueid` | A 128-bit globally unique value (UUID). | `guid("12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-1234567890ab")` |
| **`dynamic`** | | A container that can hold any of the other scalar data types, or a structured value like an **array** or a **property bag** (dictionary/JSON object). | `dynamic({"key": "value", "count": 10})` |

### Important Type Considerations

* **Case Sensitivity:** KQL is generally case-sensitive for everything, including table and column names, so ensure you use the correct casing for values, especially with strings.
* **Null Values:** All non-`string` data types include a special **`null`** value, representing the lack of data or a data mismatch. The `isnull()` function is used to check for this value.
* **`dynamic` Type:** This is particularly important when dealing with unstructured data like JSON logs in Azure Monitor. It allows you to ingest and query semi-structured data, and KQL provides specific operators (like `parse_json()`, `mv-expand`, and dynamic object accessors) to manipulate it.
