**Azure Alerts** are a fundamental component of **Azure Monitor** that help you proactively detect and address issues with your infrastructure and applications before users notice them.

They function as an automated watchdog, constantly monitoring your telemetry data (metrics, logs, and activity records) and notifying you when conditions that indicate a problem are met.

### Core Components of an Azure Alert Rule

Every alert rule is constructed from four main components:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | The **resources** that the alert rule applies to (e.g., a specific Virtual Machine, an entire Resource Group, or a Subscription). |
| **Condition** | The **logic** that determines when the alert fires. This includes the signal type (Metric, Log, etc.) and the criteria (e.g., "Average CPU Percentage is Greater than 90% for 5 minutes"). |
| **Action Group** | The **set of actions** to be taken when the alert condition is met. This defines *what* happens (e.g., send an email, call a webhook, start a runbook). |
| **Alert Details** | The metadata, including the alert **Name**, **Description**, and **Severity** (Sev0 to Sev4), used to prioritize and manage the alert instance. |

### Main Types of Azure Alert Rules

Alerts can be based on different types of data collected by Azure Monitor:

#### 1. Metric Alerts
These are the most common and are based on numerical data (metrics) collected at regular intervals.

* **Signal Used:** Numeric time-series data (e.g., CPU, Memory, Disk IO, Request Count).
* **Condition Type:** Typically uses a **threshold** (static or dynamic).
    * *Example:* Fire an alert if the **Average CPU Percentage** for a VM is **Greater than 90%** over the **last 5 minutes**.
* **Key Feature:** Supports **Dynamic Thresholds**, which use machine learning to automatically learn the resource's normal behavior and alert on deviation, reducing false positives.

#### 2. Log Search Alerts
These alerts use powerful Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries against data in a Log Analytics Workspace to find a specific pattern or count of events.

* **Signal Used:** Log data (from application logs, security events, custom logs, etc.).
* **Condition Type:** Based on the **number of results** or a **metric value** produced by a KQL query.
    * *Example:* Fire an alert if a KQL query returns **more than 10 events** with **'Error'** in the log message over the **last 15 minutes**.
* **Key Feature:** Allows for complex logic and correlation across multiple data sources.

#### 3. Activity Log Alerts
These alerts are triggered by changes and administrative operations performed on Azure resources.

* **Signal Used:** The **Azure Activity Log** (events like PUT, POST, DELETE, and changes to resource status).
* **Condition Type:** Based on the properties of an activity log event (e.g., status, resource type, operation name).
    * *Example:* Fire an alert whenever a **Virtual Machine is deleted** in a specific subscription.
* **Includes:** **Resource Health Alerts** (status of an individual resource) and **Service Health Alerts** (status of Azure services).

### Action Groups: The Response System

Action Groups are reusable, self-contained sets of notifications and automated actions. When an alert rule is triggered, it calls one or more action groups to execute the response.

Common actions include:

| Action Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Notifications** | **Email**, **SMS**, **Push** notifications to the Azure Mobile App, **Voice Call**. |
| **Automation** | **Webhook** (to integrate with external systems like Slack or ServiceNow), **Azure Function**, **Logic App**, **Automation Runbook**. |
| **ITSM** | Integration with IT Service Management tools to automatically create an incident. |

By combining the powerful data collection of Azure Monitor with customizable Alert Rules and automated Action Groups, you can create a robust, proactive monitoring solution for your cloud environment.
