Azure Application Gateway is a **web traffic load balancer** (or **Application Delivery Controller - ADC**) that operates at the application layer (**OSI Layer 7**). It enables you to manage, secure, and optimize traffic destined for your web applications.

Unlike a traditional Layer 4 load balancer (like Azure Load Balancer) which routes traffic based on IP address and port, Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on attributes of the HTTP request, such as the URL path or host header.

## Key Features of Azure Application Gateway

The gateway provides several advanced features critical for modern web applications:

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Provides centralized protection for your web applications from common web vulnerabilities and exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), based on OWASP Core Rule Sets.
* **SSL/TLS Termination:** The gateway can decrypt HTTPS traffic at the edge (the gateway itself). This **offloads** the CPU-intensive encryption/decryption task from your backend web servers, improving their performance and simplifying certificate management.
* **End-to-End SSL:** It can also re-encrypt the traffic before sending it to the backend servers for maximum security.
* **URL-based Routing (Path-based Routing):** You can direct traffic to different backend server pools based on the URL path of the request (e.g., send `contoso.com/images` to a separate image server pool and `contoso.com/api` to an API server pool).
* **Multi-Site Hosting:** Allows you to host more than one web application on the same Application Gateway instance using host headers (e.g., route traffic for `www.app1.com` and `www.app2.com` to different backend pools via a single public IP).
* **Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions):** Uses cookies to ensure all requests from a specific client in a session are directed to the same backend server.
* **Autoscaling:** The $\text{v2}$ SKU can automatically scale up or down based on your web traffic load patterns.

## Where Application Gateway is Used (Use Cases)

Application Gateway is an ideal service for any architecture involving public-facing web applications or APIs that require advanced traffic management and security.

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Key Feature Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Securing Web Apps** | Protecting public-facing web applications from malicious attacks. | **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** |
| **Hosting Multiple Sites** | Running multiple different domains or sub-domains from a single Application Gateway IP address. | **Multi-Site Hosting** |
| **Microservice Routing** | Directing users to different backend services based on the page or function they are requesting. | **URL-based Routing** |
| **Performance Optimization** | Offloading the SSL encryption/decryption workload from the web servers to the Application Gateway. | **SSL/TLS Termination** |
| **High Availability** | Ensuring all user requests are consistently sent to a healthy server instance, with session stickiness for e-commerce or login sessions. | **Health Probes, Load Balancing, Session Affinity** |
