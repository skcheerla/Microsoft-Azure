Azure Disks, specifically **Azure Managed Disks**, are **persistent, secure, and highly-available block-level storage volumes** designed to be used with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). They are the fundamental storage service for IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) workloads on Azure.

Azure manages the storage accounts associated with these disks, simplifying disk management, scaling, and high availability for you.

## 1. Managed Disks vs. Unmanaged Disks

Azure **Managed Disks** are the recommended and default choice for all new deployments, as they offer significant advantages over the legacy **Unmanaged Disks**.

| Feature | Azure Managed Disks (Recommended) | Azure Unmanaged Disks (Legacy/Retiring) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Management** | Azure handles the **Storage Account** management. You simply provision the disk. | You must manually create and manage the Storage Accounts for your disks. |
| **Scalability** | You can deploy **thousands of disks** per subscription per region. Azure automatically handles storage scale units. | You're limited by the scale limits (e.g., IOPS) of the single Storage Account you choose. |
| **Availability** | Better integration with **Availability Sets** and **Availability Zones**, ensuring disk isolation to prevent single points of failure. | Disks in an Availability Set must be manually managed to ensure they don't reside in the same storage scale unit. |
| **Simplicity** | Easy to use, simplified backup/snapshot management. | More complex, requiring manual orchestration and less automation. |

## 2. Types of Azure Managed Disks

Azure offers four primary types of Managed Disks, each optimized for different performance, cost, and capacity requirements:

### A. Ultra Disk Storage
* **Type:** High-end Solid-State Drive (SSD).
* **Scenario:** **Mission-critical** workloads like SAP HANA, high-end databases (SQL/Oracle), and other extremely IO-intensive applications.
* **Key Feature:** **Dynamic performance adjustment**. You can independently configure and change the IOPS and throughput without restarting the VM, offering flexible pay-for-performance.
* **Performance:** Highest available, with sub-millisecond latency and up to **400,000 IOPS**.

### B. Premium SSD v2
* **Type:** High-performance SSD, an evolution of Premium SSD.
* **Scenario:** Production and performance-sensitive workloads that require consistently **low latency and high IOPS**, but with more granular cost control than Ultra Disks.
* **Key Feature:** Offers the ability to **granularly adjust performance** (IOPS and throughput) independent of the disk size, similar to Ultra Disks.
* **Performance:** Excellent, up to **80,000 IOPS**.

### C. Premium SSD
* **Type:** Standard Solid-State Drive (SSD).
* **Scenario:** **Production and performance-sensitive** workloads, such as transactional databases (e.g., SQL, MySQL), medium to high-traffic web servers, and enterprise applications.
* **Key Feature:** Performance is **tied to disk size** (e.g., a P30 disk has a fixed IOPS/throughput). Supports both credit-based and on-demand bursting for temporary performance spikes.
* **Performance:** High, with single-digit millisecond latency and up to **20,000 IOPS**.

### D. Standard SSD
* **Type:** Standard Solid-State Drive (SSD).
* **Scenario:** **General-purpose** workloads, web servers, Dev/Test environments, and lightly-used enterprise applications that require **consistent performance** but are not latency-sensitive.
* **Performance:** Good balance of price and performance, with lower latency than HDDs.

### E. Standard HDD
* **Type:** Hard Disk Drive (HDD).
* **Scenario:** **Cost-effective** option for backups, non-critical, infrequent access, and archival data.
* **Performance:** Lowest performance, with latency being higher and performance varying over time.

## 3. Disk Roles

Every Azure VM uses at least two types of disks:

1.  **OS Disk:** Contains the operating system (Windows or Linux). A VM can only have one OS disk, and it must be a Managed Disk.
2.  **Data Disk(s):** Used for storing application data, databases, and other files. You can attach multiple data disks to a VM.
3.  **Temporary Disk:** A local SSD disk on the Azure host machine. It provides high-speed, temporary storage for page or swap files. **Data on this disk is lost** during a VM resize, deallocation, or host maintenance, so it should not be used for permanent data.

---

## 4. Key Capabilities

* **Snapshots:** You can take a point-in-time, read-only, crash-consistent copy of a Managed Disk. Snapshots are used for backups and creating new disks/VMs.
* **Disk Encryption:** Managed Disks support encryption by default (**Storage Service Encryption**) and can also be encrypted with **Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)** or **Customer-Managed Keys** for greater control.
* **Shared Disks:** Certain disk types (Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2) can be concurrently attached to multiple VMs, enabling high-availability clustered applications like SQL Server Failover Cluster Instances (FCI) or SAP systems.
* **Host Caching:** You can enable Read-Only or Read/Write caching on the Premium/Standard SSDs to provide lower latency and higher performance by leveraging the VM's local SSD.
* 

Based on your request for the latest table for Azure Managed Disk types and their maximum performance specifications (as is common for this kind of request when an image is uploaded with disk-related content), here is the latest comparison table:

### Azure Managed Disk Type Comparison (Maximum Specifications)

| Disk Type | Max Disk Size (GiB) | Max IOPS | Max Throughput (MB/s) | Latency (Approximate) | Primary Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ultra Disks** | 65,536 (64 TiB) | 400,000 | 10,000 | Sub-millisecond | IO-intensive workloads (SAP HANA, SQL/Oracle top-tier DBs). Performance is configurable. |
| **Premium SSD v2** | 65,536 (64 TiB) | 80,000 | 1,200 | Single-digit millisecond | Production and performance-sensitive workloads that require consistently high IOPS and throughput. Performance is tunable. |
| **Premium SSD** | 32,767 (32 TiB) | 20,000 | 900 | Single-digit millisecond | Production and performance-sensitive workloads, I/O intensive. |
| **Standard SSD** | 32,767 (32 TiB) | 6,000 | 750 | Single-digit millisecond | Web servers, lightly used enterprise applications, Dev/Test. Offers bursting capability. |
| **Standard HDD** | 32,767 (32 TiB) | 2,000 - 3,000 | 500 | High | Backup, non-critical, infrequent access. Most cost-effective. |

***

**Key Considerations:**

* **Premium SSD v2** is generally the recommended high-performance disk due to its low latency and the ability to provision capacity, IOPS, and throughput independently.
* **Ultra Disks** offer the highest IOPS and Throughput but have greater constraints on usage (e.g., cannot be used as an OS disk).
* The actual performance you achieve is also limited by the **specific VM size** you use (VM-level IOPS/throughput limits).

**Azure Disk Bursting** is a feature that allows Azure Premium SSD and Standard SSD managed disks to temporarily exceed their provisioned Input/Output Operations Per Second (**IOPS**) and throughput (MB/s) performance targets for a short period of time.

This capability is designed to handle temporary spikes in workload demand, such as:

  * ðŸš€ **Accelerating VM startup times** by boosting the OS disk performance.
  * ðŸ“Š **Handling cyclical workloads** like daily transaction processing with month-end reporting spikes.
  * ðŸ“ˆ **Managing unforeseen traffic surges** on web servers.

### **Bursting Models**

Azure offers two models for disk bursting, depending on the disk type and size:

| Bursting Model | Description | Availability | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit-Based Bursting** | The disk accumulates "credits" when its traffic is below its provisioned performance target. When demand spikes, it uses those accumulated credits to burst performance up to a maximum limit. The burst duration is typically limited to around 30 minutes per day when fully stocked with credits. | Automatically enabled for: \<ul\>\<li\>**Premium SSDs** $\le$ 512 GiB (P20 and smaller).\</li\>\<li\>**Standard SSDs** $\le$ 1,024 GiB (E30 and smaller).\</li\>\</ul\> | **No additional charges** when the disk bursts. |
| **On-Demand Bursting** | The disk bursts automatically whenever its needs exceed its provisioned capacity, up to its max burst target. This model does not rely on accumulated credits. | Available only for: \<ul\>\<li\>**Premium SSDs** $>$ 512 GiB (P30 and larger).\</li\>\</ul\> Must be explicitly enabled. | **Incurs additional charges**, including an hourly flat fee for enablement and transaction costs for burst operations beyond the provisioned target. |

-----

### **How Credit-Based Bursting Works**

The credit-based system involves three states for a disk:

1.  **Accruing:** When the disk's IO traffic is using **less** than its provisioned performance target, it accumulates burst credits.
2.  **Bursting:** When the disk's IO traffic is using **more** than its provisioned performance target, it consumes accumulated credits to temporarily exceed its limit.
3.  **Constant:** The disk's traffic is exactly at its provisioned performance target, and no credits are accrued or consumed.

Bursting for IOPS and throughput are handled independently, meaning a disk can be accruing IOPS credits while simultaneously spending throughput credits, or vice versa.

The maximum burst performance is generally much higher than the provisioned performance for smaller disk sizes, for instance, a Premium SSD P4 disk (120 IOPS provisioned) can burst up to 3,500 IOPS.
