**Azure Management Groups** provide a level of scope **above subscriptions** to manage access, policy, and compliance efficiently across multiple Azure subscriptions. They act as logical containers, allowing organizations to create a hierarchical structure that maps to their organizational or operational model.

This is primarily used for **governance at scale**, as any governance conditions applied to a management group are **automatically inherited** by all subscriptions and resources underneath it.

***

## Management Group Hierarchy

The structure of management groups is a single hierarchy within your Azure tenant:

* **Tenant Root Group:** The highest-level management group, automatically created by Azure, under which all other management groups and subscriptions reside. Governance applied here affects *everything* in the tenant.
* **Management Groups:** You create these to organize subscriptions into a tree-like structure, reflecting your business units (e.g., HR, Finance), geographical regions (e.g., APAC, EMEA), or environments (e.g., Production, Development).
* **Subscriptions:** These are placed under a management group and act as a boundary for billing and resource allocation.
* **Resource Groups & Resources:** These are the lowest levels, where the actual Azure services reside.

The hierarchy can support up to **six levels of depth** (excluding the root and subscription levels).

## Key Uses and Benefits

Management groups are critical for establishing **consistent governance** across a large Azure environment:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Centralized Access Control (RBAC)** | You can assign an **Azure Role** (like Reader, Contributor, or Owner) at the management group level, and it will be inherited by all child management groups and all subscriptions within the group. |
| **Policy Enforcement** | You can assign **Azure Policies** (e.g., restricting resource creation to specific regions or allowing only certain VM sizes) to a management group, ensuring that all underlying subscriptions and resources comply. |
| **Compliance at Scale** | Ensures that security, regulatory, and cost management rules are applied consistently from the top-down, reducing manual configuration and the risk of misconfigurations. |
| **Organization** | Allows you to align your Azure structure with your company's hierarchy, making it easier to manage and attribute costs. |
