The **Azure Compute Unit (ACU)** is a Microsoft-supplied metric used to compare the **relative CPU performance** across different Azure Virtual Machine (VM) sizes and series (SKUs).

* **Relative Measure**: ACU is a benchmark number that helps you understand the compute power difference between various VM types. It does *not* compare other VM characteristics like memory, storage throughput, or disk IOPS.
* **Baseline**: The ACU concept is typically standardized on a baseline VM size (e.g., an older Standard\_A1 VM or similar, depending on the documentation) being assigned a value, often **100**. All other VM sizes are then assigned a relative ACU rating based on how much faster they perform on a standard compute benchmark.
* **Purpose**: It helps customers select the appropriate VM series and size by providing a consistent way to evaluate the raw processing power for their workloads, aiding in performance planning and cost optimization. A VM with a higher ACU value generally has better CPU performance per vCPU.

### Azure Cloud Concepts Summary

* **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: On-demand, scalable computing resources that give you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware. They offer OS-level control.
* **Availability Set**: A logical grouping capability for VMs that ensures the VMs you place within it are distributed across multiple isolated hardware nodes, fault domains, and update domains in a datacenter. This protects against datacenter failures and planned maintenance.
* **Network Security Group (NSG)**: A security layer for managing network traffic to and from Azure resources within an Azure Virtual Network. NSGs contain security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.
* **Virtual Network (VNet)**: The fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. It enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines, to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. A VNet is logically isolated from the rest of the Azure cloud.

### Azure VM Sizes and SKUs

Azure VMs come in a variety of **Stock Keeping Units (SKUs)**, often grouped into series, which are optimized for different types of workloads:

* **General Purpose**: Provides a balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small-to-medium databases, and low-to-medium traffic web servers (e.g., Dv-series, Av2-series).
* **Compute Optimized**: High CPU-to-memory ratio. Excellent for medium traffic web servers, application servers, and batch processes (e.g., Fs-series).
* **Memory Optimized**: High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium-to-large caches, and in-memory analytics (e.g., Ev3-series, M-series).
* **Storage Optimized**: High disk throughput and IOPS. Best for workloads that require heavy disk I/O, such as NoSQL databases (e.g., Ls-series).
* **GPU**: Specialized VMs with NVIDIA GPUs. Designed for compute-intensive, graphics-intensive, and visualization workloads, including machine learning and deep learning (e.g., N-series).
* **High Performance Compute (HPC)**: Fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (InfiniBand). Used for high-end computational problems and parallel processing (e.g., H-series).

### Other Core Concepts

* **Azure SKUs (Stock Keeping Units)**: In Azure, an SKU is essentially a specific commercial or technical offering for a service, product, or plan. For Virtual Machines, the SKU defines the specific configuration, including the VM size, series, region availability, and associated pricing model.
* **Azure Bastion**: A fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your VMs directly through the Azure portal over SSL/TLS. Since it requires no public IP on your VMs, it provides enhanced security.
* **Update Management in Azure**: A feature within Azure Automation that allows you to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux VMs across Azure, on-premises, and other cloud environments. It helps you assess the status of available updates, schedule installation, and review deployment results to maintain compliance.
