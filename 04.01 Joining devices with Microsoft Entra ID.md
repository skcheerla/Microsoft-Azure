Joining devices with **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) is a critical step for modern identity and access management. It allows for single sign-on (SSO) to cloud and on-premises resources and enables Conditional Access policies.

Here are the three main ways devices can be joined to Microsoft Entra ID, along with an explanation of MDM and MAM concepts.

## Device Join Methods

The three main methods for connecting devices to Microsoft Entra ID are:

### 1. Microsoft Entra Registered (Formerly Azure AD Registered) üì±

This is primarily for **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** or personal mobile devices.

* **Definition:** The device is **registered** in Microsoft Entra ID but **not controlled** by the organization at the operating system level.
* **Sign-in:** Users sign in with a **personal** account (e.g., local account, Microsoft consumer account) but add their work or school account via the **"Access work or school"** settings (Windows) or an application sign-in (iOS/Android).
* **Ownership:** **User-owned** (Personal).
* **Management:** Typically managed by **Mobile Application Management (MAM)** policies to protect corporate data within specific apps.
* **SSO:** Provides Single Sign-On to **cloud resources** (like Microsoft 365) via a Primary Refresh Token (PRT).
* **Provisioning:** Self-service by the user.

### 2. Microsoft Entra Joined (Formerly Azure AD Joined) üíª

This is for **cloud-only** or **cloud-first** organizations using Windows 10/11 devices.

* **Definition:** The device is **joined directly** to Microsoft Entra ID and is controlled by the organization. **No on-premises Active Directory (AD)** is required for primary sign-in.
* **Sign-in:** Users sign in with their **organizational Microsoft Entra ID** account.
* **Ownership:** **Organization-owned**.
* **Management:** Fully managed by a **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** solution like Microsoft Intune, with no Group Policy Objects (GPOs) from traditional AD.
* **SSO:** Provides SSO to **both cloud and, potentially, on-premises resources** (with prerequisites like cloud trust).
* **Provisioning:** Windows Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) self-service, Windows Autopilot, or Bulk Enrollment.

### 3. Microsoft Entra Hybrid Joined (Formerly Hybrid Azure AD Joined) üè¢

This is for organizations with an **existing on-premises Active Directory (AD)** infrastructure.

* **Definition:** The device is **joined** to the **on-premises Active Directory** (AD Domain Joined) **and simultaneously registered** with Microsoft Entra ID.
* **Sign-in:** Users sign in with their **on-premises AD** account, which is synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.
* **Ownership:** **Organization-owned**.
* **Management:** Can be managed by traditional methods like **Group Policy** and **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**, or modernized via **co-management** with MDM (Intune).
* **SSO:** Provides SSO to **both cloud and on-premises resources**.
* **Provisioning:** Typically automated via **Microsoft Entra Connect** (sync tool) which writes a Service Connection Point (SCP) into the on-premises AD, triggering devices to automatically register. Requires network line of sight to a domain controller periodically.

## Device Management Concepts

Device management in Microsoft Entra ID environments is handled through two main approaches: **MDM** and **MAM**, often using **Microsoft Intune** as the management platform.

### Mobile Device Management (MDM) üõ°Ô∏è

**MDM** focuses on managing the **entire device**.

* **Focus:** **Device-centric** management.
* **Mechanism:** Requires the device to be **enrolled** into the MDM service (like Intune). This gives the organization **full control** over the device operating system.
* **Control Level:** High. It can enforce device-level policies like:
    * Requiring a device passcode/PIN.
    * Enforcing disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker).
    * Installing or uninstalling corporate apps.
    * Performing a full remote wipe of the entire device.
* **Best For:** **Organization-owned** devices (Microsoft Entra Joined or Hybrid Joined).

### Mobile Application Management (MAM) üîí

**MAM** focuses on managing and protecting **corporate data within specific applications**, regardless of the device's enrollment status.

* **Focus:** **Application-centric** management.
* **Mechanism:** Uses **App Protection Policies** to secure data inside managed applications (e.g., Outlook, OneDrive, Teams) that have been integrated with the Intune App SDK. The device itself is **not enrolled**.
* **Control Level:** Lower (compared to MDM). It can enforce policies like:
    * Restricting copy/paste of corporate data to unmanaged apps (e.g., copying a file from corporate OneDrive to a personal Dropbox).
    * Requiring an app-level PIN/biometric to open a managed app.
    * Encrypting corporate data at rest within the app's local storage.
    * Performing a **selective wipe** of only the corporate data within managed applications.
* **Best For:** **Personal/BYOD** devices (Microsoft Entra Registered), as it protects corporate data while respecting user privacy.
