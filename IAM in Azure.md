That's an excellent breakdown of the different types of roles in Azure! Understanding these distinctions is key to managing access and permissions effectively.

Here is an explanation of each point to clarify the roles in Azure Cloud.

## 1. Three Kinds of Roles in Azure

Azure utilizes three distinct types of roles, each controlling access to different resources:

### Classic Subscription Administrator Roles
These are the original roles used for the **classic (Azure Service Manager/ASM) deployment model**. While they offered simple, broad access, they are largely **deprecated** (retired) and replaced by Azure RBAC roles.

* They had high privileges and were typically assigned at the subscription level.
* **Recommendation:** Microsoft strongly advises transitioning these roles to the modern Azure Roles (RBAC) for better security and granular control.

### Azure Roles (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control)
These are the **modern, primary authorization system** for managing access to **Azure resources**.

* They provide **fine-grained access management** (using the principle of least privilege) for resources like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, databases, and more.
* They are managed through **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** and can be applied at various **scopes** (Management Group, Subscription, Resource Group, or individual Resource).
* Azure has over 100 built-in roles, and you can create **custom roles**.

### Azure AD Roles (Microsoft Entra Roles)
These roles control access to **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)** and related services like Microsoft 365.

* They manage **identity and access** features, such as creating users, managing groups, registering applications, and managing licenses.
* Their scope is the **tenant/directory**.
* They *do not* grant permissions to manage Azure compute/storage resources (unless specifically elevated, like the Global Administrator activating the **User Access Administrator** role).

## 2. Four Important Azure Built-in Roles (RBAC)

These are the most fundamental **Azure Roles (RBAC)**, primarily used for managing Azure infrastructure resources.

| Role | Permissions | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Owner** | Grants **full access** to all resources in the scope, **including the right to delegate access to others** (assign RBAC roles). | Subscription, Resource Group, Resource |
| **Contributor** | Can **create and manage all types of Azure resources** but **cannot grant access to others** (cannot manage RBAC role assignments). | Subscription, Resource Group, Resource |
| **Reader** | Can **view existing Azure resources** (read-only access) but cannot make any changes. | Subscription, Resource Group, Resource |
| **User Access Administrator** | The main role for **managing user access** to Azure resources (RBAC role assignments). It can assign roles, but has no permissions to manage resources (e.g., cannot delete a VM) unless combined with another role like Contributor. | Subscription, Resource Group, Resource |

## 3. Classic Administrator Roles (Deprecated)

These roles are part of the old model and are in the process of being retired. They applied to the entire subscription.

| Classic Role | Function | Equivalent Modern Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Administrator** | Primarily related to **billing** and managing the Azure account. This person owns the subscription. | *Retained, related to billing* |
| **Service Administrator** | Had **full access** to manage services within the Azure portal using both the classic and ARM deployment models. | **Owner** (at the subscription scope) |
| **Co-Administrator** | Had **full access** to manage services in the subscription, similar to the Service Administrator, but they could be assigned to multiple users. | **Owner** (at the subscription scope) |

## 4. Important Azure AD Roles (Microsoft Entra Roles)

These roles grant permissions to manage identity and access within Microsoft Entra ID and related Microsoft services.

| Azure AD Role | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Global Administrator** | **Highest privileged role** in the Azure AD tenant. Has unlimited access to all administrative features and can manage all aspects of the directory, users, groups, and licenses, as well as elevate their access to Azure resources (becoming a **User Access Administrator** on all subscriptions). **Should be limited to a few users.** |
| **User Administrator** | Can **create and manage all aspects of users and groups** (except for limited administrators) and manage support tickets. They can also reset passwords for non-administrators and certain other roles. |
| **Billing Administrator** | Manages **billing, purchases, subscriptions, and service requests**. They can make purchases and view service health, but generally do not have the permissions to manage resources or assign licenses/roles unless granted separately. |
