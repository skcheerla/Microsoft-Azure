## Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

**Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)** let you create and manage a group of load-balanced Virtual Machines (VMs). The number of VM instances can automatically **increase (scale-out)** or **decrease (scale-in)** in response to demand or a defined schedule. They provide high availability, application resiliency, and the ability to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of identical VMs.

### Associate a Load Balancer with Scale Sets
To distribute incoming traffic across the VM instances, a Scale Set must be associated with a load balancer.

* **Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4):** Provides basic, high-performance, low-latency distribution of network traffic at the transport layer (TCP, UDP).
* **Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7):** Provides advanced traffic management capabilities, including Web Application Firewall (WAF), SSL/TLS termination, and URL-based routing.

When a Scale Set is created with a load balancer, the new VM instances are automatically added to the load balancer's backend pool.

## Scaling Policy in Scale Sets and Scale Rules

The **Scaling Policy** for a Scale Set defines the automation process that dictates when and how the number of VM instances should change.

* **Scaling Policy:** The entire configuration for automatic scaling (Autoscale) for a resource. This includes the minimum, maximum, and default number of instances.
* **Scale Rules (Autoscale Rules):** These are the specific conditions that trigger a scale-out or scale-in action. They are defined within the scaling policy and can be:
    * **Metric-based:** Triggered when a performance metric (e.g., Average CPU usage, Disk I/O) crosses a defined threshold for a specific duration.
    * **Time-based (Schedule):** Triggered based on a fixed schedule (e.g., scale out to 10 instances every weekday morning).

### Scale Rules Logic
* **Scale-Out (adding instances):** Triggered if **ANY** scale-out rule is met (uses the **OR** operator).
* **Scale-In (removing instances):** Triggered only if **ALL** scale-in rules are met (uses the **AND** operator).

## What is App Insights in Azure

**Azure Application Insights (App Insights)** is an **Application Performance Management (APM)** service, a feature of Azure Monitor.

* **Purpose:** It monitors live web applications running anywhere (on-premises, Azure, or other clouds).
* **What it tracks:** Requests, response times, exceptions, dependencies, user sessions, custom events, and performance counters.
* **Integration with VMSS:** Scale Sets can send custom application metrics to App Insights, which can then be used as a source for **metric-based scale rules** to achieve more intelligent scaling based on application-level load (e.g., number of active users, queue length) rather than just VM CPU.

### What is Azure Diagnostic Extension

The **Azure Diagnostics Extension** is an agent running inside an Azure VM's guest operating system that collects monitoring data, logs, and performance counters from the VM.

* **Purpose:** It sends this telemetry data to various storage destinations, including Azure Storage, Azure Monitor Metrics, and Event Hubs.
* **Use with VMSS:** In the context of Scale Sets, it's the component that gathers the fundamental performance counters (like `% CPU`, memory usage) from the VM instances, which are then used by the Autoscale engine to evaluate metric-based scale rules.

## Scale-in Policy and Upgrade Policy

### Scale-in Policy
The **Scale-in Policy** determines which specific VM instances are selected for deletion when a scale-in event is triggered. This is important to ensure that critical or newest instances are not removed unintentionally.

| Policy | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Default** | Prioritizes balancing VMs across Availability Zones and Fault Domains, then deletes the VM with the **highest instance ID** (which is usually the newest). |
| **OldestVM** | Prioritizes balancing, then deletes the **oldest VM** in the scale set. This is often used to ensure the scale set uses the latest VM configuration. |
| **NewestVM** | Prioritizes balancing, then deletes the **newest VM**. This is useful for removing instances that haven't been fully utilized yet or if you want to keep the longest-running, most stable instances. |

### Upgrade Policy
The **Upgrade Policy** defines how changes to the Scale Set model (e.g., OS image updates, configuration changes, or installing a new extension) are applied to the existing VM instances.

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Automatic** | Azure automatically updates instances in batches without user intervention, ensuring a specific number of instances are always available. It integrates with health probes. Best for production. |
| **Manual** | No automatic updates are applied. You must manually initiate the upgrade on specific instances. Provides maximum control. |
| **Rolling** | Updates are applied in configurable batches with optional pauses. It's similar to Automatic but offers more granular control over batch size and health thresholds, which is ideal for production workloads. |

## Azure Scale Set Health Monitoring and Repair

### Azure Scale Set Health Monitoring
Scale Sets rely on two primary mechanisms to determine the health of individual instances, which is critical for rolling upgrades and automatic repairs.

#### 2 Modes of Health Monitoring
1.  **Load Balancer Health Probes:** An external probe that monitors a specific port/path on the VM. It is the simpler, Layer 4 approach.
2.  **Application Health Extension:** A dedicated agent deployed inside the VM (in the guest OS). It probes a local application endpoint to get a richer application-level health status. It supports **Binary Health States** (Healthy/Unhealthy) or **Rich Health States** (Healthy/Unhealthy/Initializing/Unknown) for finer control during initialization.

### Automatic Repair Policy
The **Automatic Repair Policy** uses the instance health signals (from either the Load Balancer probe or the Health Extension) to automatically initiate repair actions on unhealthy instances.

* **Action:** If an instance is marked as **Unhealthy** or **Unknown** for a period longer than the configured **grace period**, the policy can trigger a repair action, such as **reimaging** the instance or deleting and **creating a new replacement**.
* **Goal:** To maintain a high availability of healthy instances without requiring manual intervention.

## Azure Scale Sets - Advanced Allocation Policy

### Proximity Placement Groups (PPG)
A **Proximity Placement Group (PPG)** is a logical grouping that ensures Azure compute resources (VMs, Availability Sets, or Scale Sets) are physically located **close to each other** within the same datacenter.

* **Goal:** To achieve the **lowest possible network latency** between the resources, which is essential for certain high-performance and distributed applications (e.g., financial trading platforms, gaming backends).
* **Effect:** It is a colocation constraint, meaning it is *possible* for an allocation request to fail if capacity is not available in the required low-latency cluster.

### Single Placement Group
The **Single Placement Group** setting applies to Scale Sets with **Uniform Orchestration Mode** (the original mode).

* **Concept:** A single placement group represents a unit of deployment within an Azure region or Availability Zone.
* **Limit:** If this setting is set to **True** (the default), the scale set is constrained to one placement group, which limits the number of instances to a maximum of **600-1000 VMs** (depending on the image type).
* **Scaling beyond the limit:** To scale beyond the single placement group limit, this setting must be set to **False**, allowing the Scale Set to span multiple placement groups.
