The **Azure Pricing Calculator** is a free, web-based tool provided by Microsoft to help you estimate the potential costs of using Azure services.

It is an essential tool for budget planning, migration cost analysis, and comparing different service configurations before you deploy any resources.

### **Official Azure Pricing Calculator Page**

The official portal for the calculator is:
**[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)**

### **Key Features and How to Use It**

1.  **Select Your Services:** You start by selecting the Azure services you plan to use (e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage, Azure SQL Database, Networking) from the **Product Picker**.
2.  **Configure Parameters:** For each service you add to your estimate, you define the specifics of your intended usage. This is the most crucial step for accuracy. Common parameters include:
    * **Region:** Price can vary significantly based on the Azure region you select.
    * **Tier/SKU:** The size and performance level (e.g., VM size, Storage redundancy level).
    * **Usage:** Estimated consumption (e.g., hours per month for a VM, GB of storage, number of database transactions, outbound data transfer/bandwidth).
    * **Operating System & Licensing:** Specify the OS (Windows/Linux) and apply discounts like **Azure Hybrid Benefit** for existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses.
3.  **Apply Cost-Saving Options:** The calculator allows you to model various discount programs to see potential savings:
    * **Reservations:** Discounts for committing to a 1-year or 3-year term for select resources.
    * **Azure Savings Plan for Compute:** Flexible commitment that saves money on select compute services globally.
    * **Dev/Test Pricing:** Special rates for workloads not in production.
4.  **Review the Estimate:** The tool provides a detailed breakdown of estimated monthly costs, including upfront costs (if any). You can change the currency displayed.
5.  **Save and Share:**
    * If you sign in, you can **save** your estimate to your account.
    * You can **export** the estimate as an Excel (.xlsx) file or a PDF to share with your team or for budgeting purposes.

If you are planning a migration from an on-premises data center to Azure, you should also use the **TCO Calculator**. This tool helps you:

* **Input** your existing on-premises server, storage, and networking costs.
* **Compare** your current spending (including hardware, power, labor, and maintenance) with the estimated costs of running the equivalent workload on Azure.
* **Generate a report** that illustrates the potential cost savings of moving to the cloud.
