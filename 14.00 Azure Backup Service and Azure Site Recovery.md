## Azure Backup Service and Azure Site Recovery

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Azure Backup Service** | A cloud-based data protection solution that provides **backup and restoration** capabilities for data and workloads running both in Azure and on-premises. It focuses on **restoring data** from a point in time (like an insurance policy for your data). |
| **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** | A **Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)** solution that focuses on **business continuity** by replicating workloads (such as Azure VMs or on-premises physical/virtual servers) to Azure or a secondary site. The goal is to keep applications and services **running** during major outages by quickly failing over to the replicated environment. |

## Azure Backup Components

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **MARS Vaults in Azure (Azure Recovery Services Vault)** | A **management entity** in Azure that acts as a container to store the backups, or "recovery points," created over time for various workloads. It's used by both Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery. It provides a central place for backup-related operations, monitoring, and policy management. |
| **MARS Agent** | The **Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent** is a piece of software installed on on-premises Windows machines or Azure VMs (to protect specific files/folders) to back up files, folders, and system state directly to a **Recovery Services vault** in Azure. |
| **Backup Policy** | A set of **rules** that defines **how and when** backups are taken and how long they are **retained**. A policy includes the backup schedule (frequency and time) and the retention duration (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly retention points). |

| Term | Description | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RTO** | **Recovery Time Objective** | The **maximum acceptable duration** of time from the moment an application or system fails until it is restored and available to the user. It measures the acceptable **downtime**. |
| **RPO** | **Recovery Point Objective** | The **maximum acceptable amount of data loss**, measured in time, that an application can tolerate from the point of failure back to the last valid backup or replication point. It measures the acceptable **data loss**. |
